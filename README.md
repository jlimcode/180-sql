# Free SQL Course Materials

I recently taught a course on SQL and data analytics to my college club. As part of the course, I created a final project that runs on Google Colab. The project uses the Chinook database and covers SQL questions that I believe are useful for business-oriented college students.

You can find the full project, along with a separate solutions file, in this repository. I've also included additional resources at the end of the project to help with learning and applying SQL.

I'd like to give special thanks to Professor Michael Tsiang for his help in developing the course content.
